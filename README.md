Hi, I'm Huy Nguyen, a Software Engineer :computer: from Vietnam. I'm currently working for MiTek. Beside programming, I enjoy games :video_game:, food :poultry_leg: and musics :musical_keyboard:.

About me :frog:
========
* :rocket: I'm a Software Engineer with most experiences in C# Library and Windows WPF.
* :office: I'm working in Building Industry software now.
* :game_die: My favorite subject is game development. But seem like I don't have a change yet.
* :eyes: I'm a on-time type of person, sometimes it's become a really hard problem.
